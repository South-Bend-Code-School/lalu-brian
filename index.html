      <p>I like drawing a lot. I particually like drawing about video games, like Mega Man and Sonic the Hedgehog.</p>
      <p>As far as materials go, I use any paper I can get my hands on, use pencils to draw the lines, and colored pencils to color them in.</p>
      <p>I also like drawing robots. It gives a lot of creativity to make new characters.</p>
